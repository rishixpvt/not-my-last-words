    <h2>ðŸŒ¸ Secret Message ðŸŒ¸</h2>
    <p>
      My love, I want you to know that the reason I stopped messaging you isn't because my feelings have changed. It's because of the mistake I made by sending that message on WhatsApp, which was unfortunately seen by your mother. I know how difficult things have become for you since then, and the last thing I ever want is to be a burden or make your life harder. Thatâ€™s why I chose to step back. On the outside, I might seem okay, but the truth is, every time I close my eyes, memories of you flood in and I can't stop the tears, no matter how hard I try. It hurts deeply, because itâ€™s not over for meâ€”not even close. Another reason Iâ€™ve held back is because I made a promise not to contact you anymore, a promise Iâ€™ve tried to keep, and I know that even sending this message breaks it. But I hope you understandâ€”I just needed you to know. Please, donâ€™t tell anyone about this message. Iâ€™ll continue to wait for you, no matter how long it takes. I know I couldnâ€™t be your first love, but I still hope to be your last, your forever. If ever you feel like talking, if you need meâ€”Iâ€™ll be here, always ready to reply. I love you, beyond words, until the very last breath I take, even if the world itself fades away.
